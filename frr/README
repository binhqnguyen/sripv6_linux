Scripts to run Free Range Routing's OSPF on profile sripv6-v3 in PhantomNet (https://www.phantomnet.org/show-profile.php?uuid=dfcfe493-56a9-11e7-91c5-90e2ba22fee4)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A. How to set up basic IPv6 with OSPF? Everything is running on Node1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Obtain interfaces information by: ./get_all_info.sh. Result is in net_info.sh
2. Add global IPv6 addresses to interfaces: ./add_global_ipv6.sh
3. Create and install configuration files for FRR's Zebra and OSPF6. The configuration is copied to /usr/local/etc/ on each node after running the command:
	./create_all_zebra_conf.sh
	./create_all_ospf_conf.sh
4. Run FRR on node 2, 3, 4:
	./start_all_frr.sh
5. After several seconds, the routes are populated by OSPF. Check routes on node 2,3,4 using:
	ip -6 route
6. Install default routes on the end hosts: node1 and node 5
	./install_default_route_on_hosts.sh
6. Ping test from node 1 to 5:
	ping6 <node 5's nete IPv6 address>

B. Combining OSPF with SR. Again, everything is run on node1:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. After part A, enable SR flags on the routers:
	./enable_sr_flags.sh
2. Install SR rules, for high bandwidth path (1->2->4->3->5):
	./ul_adj.sh
	./dl_adj.sh
3. Install SR rules, for low delay, low bandwidth path (1->2->3->5) the path is enable by OSPF as default:
	./del_sr.sh


Other scripts:
--------------
1. kill_frr.sh: kill zebra and ospf deamons on a OSPF router.
2. start_frr.sh: start zebra and ospf deamons on a OSPF router.
3. zebra/ospf.log: log files of zebra and ospf.
4. other scripts are irrelevant, park here now for later use.
