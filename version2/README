Scripts to install SR for a topology in the phantomnet profile (sripv6-v2): https://www.phantomnet.org/show-profile.php?uuid=5596f45b-550e-11e7-ac8f-90e2ba22fee4
---------------------------------------------------

How to run?
1. Obtain interfaces information by: ./get_all_info.sh. Result is in net_info.sh
2. Add global IPv6 addresses to interfaces: ./add_global_ipv6.sh
3. Install routes for the topology (mimicking OSPF, but manually): ./install_routes.sh
4. Scenario 1: Install an longer SR path (mimicking adjacency segment at ingress node): 
	./del_sr.sh #delete existing segment routing rules.
	./ul_adj.sh
	./dl_adj.sh
	PING from node 1 to node 5: ping6 -I <node1's neta interface> <node5's nete interface IP>
	#!!!!!NOTE: IF using IPERF: need to set the Segment Size to around 1350B, if segment 1400B is used 
	node 2 can't receive packets from node 1.
5. Scenario 2: Install a shortes SR path (mimicking node segment at ingress node):
	./del_sr.sh #delete existing segment routing rules.
	./ul_node.sh
	./dl_node.sh
	PING from node 1 to node 5: ping6 -I <node1's neta interface> <node5's nete interface IP>
